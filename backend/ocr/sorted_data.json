In\nthe late 1800s and early 1900s, there were many wireless scientists, experimenters, and\nhol Dbyists. In these early days, transmitting distances were limited and population density\n__was low; it was unnecessary to require a license for transmitting. As more wireless stations\ncame on the air, interference between stations became a serious problem. In 1921, the United\n_ States government began requiring licenses for all transmitters, including commercial\nbroadcast transmitters, experimental transmitters, and amateur radio transmitters.\n [paae an ne vi apidly during the remainder of the 20th century.\na ae eaaenioe soulate radio transmissions and to license radio trans-\n- se . .\n3 11 These lice jlayed a useful role because they allowed many\n\" C er 9 svst ) sk vailable radio frequencies without interfering with\n4 The \u00a2 Co vas that it took both time and money to obtain a\n~~ ansn | This limited the use of broadband wireless\n\u2014 2( etl peel Is who could afford the cost of obtaining the\ni | snsive Wireless equipment.\n\u2019 by \u2018a Be\n\u00a3 re ~; | os, 4\n\f",
